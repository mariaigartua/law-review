Hello! 

Thank you so much for displaying interest in being part of the Law Journal! This is our first year in operation and we are ecstatic to see how the semester goes. We are kickstarting this semester with some events but wanted to give you a brief overview of what we aim to accomplish! 

Our main aim is to publish a Law Journal (hence the name haha) featuring your work! We will have a few general body meetings dispersed throughout the semester during which you can attend and learn different ways to contribute. As indicated by the form, there are many ways one can contribute to the Journal and we are interested in channeling all that our members can offer. Stay tuned for more emails from us! 

That said, come to our first event!
